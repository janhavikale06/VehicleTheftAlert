VEHICLE THEFT ALERT &amp; ENGINE LOCK SYSTEM USING ARM7

The theft alert system makes use of PIR Motion Sensor which detects the motion of objects and GSM (Global System for Mobile) which is embedded in the vehicle to communicate with the vehicle's owner's mobile phone. By using PIR Motion Sensor, we will detect theft and display the message as “Theft Detection!” on LCD. In GSM technology, the communication is established either by an SMS or calling but we prefer the communication via SMS (between GSM and the owner's mobile phone). The communication established include – Sending of an SMS by GSM to the owner's mobile phone to provide all information about the vehicle and vice-versa.
In this system we are going to use two keys to open the vehicle lock, one is the owner’s key which is used by the owner and other is the direct key which is used by an unauthorized person. Whenever the direct key is used, the alarm becomes active and gives the beep sound which indicates that the thief is detected. At the same time a warning SMS is sent by GSM to the registered mobile number. After receiving the message, the vehicle’s owner sent a message to remotely lock the engine, after turning.
